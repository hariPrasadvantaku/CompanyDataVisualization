Stock Dashboard Visualization
This project is a Stock Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that dynamically visualizes stock market data. The application fetches data from a JSON file (data.json) and presents it in an interactive format. Users can select a company from a list to view corresponding stock performance charts, including key metrics like opening value, closing value, volume, and more.
